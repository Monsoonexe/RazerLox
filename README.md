# LoxInterpreter

A CSharp implementation of a Lox interpreter from http://craftinginterpreters.com/ by Bob Nystromhttps://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters
It's called RazerLox because... well, razers are sharp.

The ASTGenerator is written in Powershell for convenience (and coolness, because Powershell runs on .net also).

This repo includes the Tree-Walker Interpreter. I completed some of the chapter challenges, and in a few cases added my own features for fun. The function names and syntax is slightly different from that in the book to fit the standard C# conventions (and my own coding style, cuz I'm the boss of this code!)

Props to Rob Nystrom for writing a banger book explaining the content so well. I'll always be haunted by the Lexical Analygator.
